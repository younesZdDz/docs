<Warning>
  Your API key grants significant privileges, so it's essential to keep it
  secure! Avoid sharing your secret API keys in publicly accessible locations
  like GitHub, client-side code, or similar platforms.
</Warning>
Once your account is set up and you have obtained the API key, the next step is to
use it to send requests to all other endpoints. The API key must be included as a
query parameter in all requests.
